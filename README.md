# Tekken Tables

T8 Table:
<br>For version: 2.06.01
<br>Just a table for finding info about frame data. It's not perfect but it does the job.

T6 Arcade Table:
<br>A Cheat Engine table for the newly released arcade version of Tekken 6 on rpcs3. It has three options:
<br>Stop Match Timer
<br>Stop Character Select Timer
<br>Infinite Health for All

T5DR Table:
<br>MovePopulator uses sdtekken.com info to populate wavu wiki style entries.
<br>Display attack data while in game using rpcs3. Janky but works kind of.
