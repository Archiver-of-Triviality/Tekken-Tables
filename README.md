# Tekken Tables

T8 Table:
For version: 2.00.01
Just a table for finding info about frame data. It's not perfect but it does the job.

T6 Arcade Table:
A Cheat Engine table for the newly released arcade version of Tekken 6 on rpcs3. It has three options:
Stop Match Timer
Stop Character Select Timer
Infinite Health for All

T5DR Table:
MovePopulator uses sdtekken.com info to populate wavu wiki style entries.
Display attack data while in game using rpcs3. Janky but works kind of.
